# Code Quality Standards

Always apply these standards to all code you write.

For Ralph's Docker Sandboxes naming conventions (per-agent + per-project, used at startup and during cleanup), see @RALPH.md.

## Reuse Before Creating

Before writing new code, analyze existing utilities, components, hooks, helpers and tests:

1. **Search first** — grep/glob for similar functionality before implementing
2. **Extend if close** — if something exists that's 80% of what you need, extend it
3. **Extract if duplicating** — if you're about to copy-paste, extract to shared module instead

## File Size & Organization

Keep files between **200-300 lines max**. If a file exceeds this:

1. **Split by responsibility** — one module = one concern
2. **Extract sub-components** — UI pieces that can stand alone should
3. **Separate logic from presentation** — hooks/utils in their own files
4. **Group by feature** — co-locate related files, not by type

Signs a file needs splitting:
- Multiple unrelated exports
- Scrolling to find what you need
- "Utils" file becoming a junk drawer
- Component doing data fetching + transformation + rendering

## Task Execution

- **One task per invocation.** When working from `.agent/tasks.json`, complete exactly one task, commit, and stop. Never batch multiple tasks.

## Code Style

1. Prefer writing clear code and use inline comments sparingly
2. Document methods with block comments at the top of the method
3. Use Conventional Commit format

## Test To Verify Functionality

If you didn't test it, it doesn't work.

Verify written code by:
- Running unit tests
- Running end to end tests
- Checking for type errors
- Checking for lint errors
- Smoke testing and checking for runtime errors with Playwright
- Taking screenshots and verifying the UI is as expected

# This is NOT the Turborepo you know

Turborepo configuration, task behavior, and CLI commands can vary between installed versions and may differ from your training data. Resolve the `turbo` package from this file's directory or relevant workspace; in monorepos, it may not be visible from the repository root. For example, run `node -p "require.resolve('turbo/package.json')"` from a workspace that depends on `turbo`.

Read `docs/README.md` inside that installed package first, then read the relevant pages from its `docs/` directory before changing Turborepo configuration or commands. Heed deprecation notices. These bundled docs match the installed package version and are available without network access.

This block is written and re-added by `turbo` before repository-scoped commands when an AI agent is detected. In the Turborepo source repository, its template is defined in `crates/turborepo-cli/src/cli/agent_guidance.rs`. Removing the managed block while updates are enabled means a later qualifying invocation will add it again. Set `"agentGuidance": false` in the root `turbo.json` or `turbo.jsonc` to opt out; this does not remove an existing block. Keep the block committed with your work to avoid an uncommitted change on the next agent invocation.
